{"email_subject": "Brown bag thank you", "email_body": "Dear Jennifer, Thank you for hosting a brown bag lunch session yesterday; your presentation was very informative and I believe it led to greater understanding of Business Development within GSS. On a personal level, I was very interested in your Continental deal and would like to read a white paper or postmortems analysis of the deal after it closes. I also thank you for taking an active role in this mornings' brown bag, I felt like it lent additional credibility to Experience Enron and answered the inevitable \"what's in it for me\" questions. Sincerely, Jim Wininger", "id": "14926222_1075849626786_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
