The exterior will be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back. I am considering the following features: stained and scored concrete floors, an open living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms all upstairs. I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly country. Can you help?
