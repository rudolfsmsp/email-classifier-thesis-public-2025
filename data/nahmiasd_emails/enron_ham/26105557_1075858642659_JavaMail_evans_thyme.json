Phillip -----Original Message----- From: Greg Thorse <gthorse@keyad.com>@ENRON Sent: Wednesday, August 22, 2001 4:59 PM To: Allen, Phillip K. Subject: Bishops Corner Phillip; I see that you talked to Andrew this afternoon so that you have an understanding of where we are on that front. I am still analyzing the demand/supply numbers we talked about. I am going to be working in Austin in the morning and San Marcos in the afternoon. I have a number of things to verify before I feel I can finish the supply/demand question accurately. I also need to follow up on the permits and see where they are in process, I need to check on Tas review and a number of other items. Talk to you soon.
