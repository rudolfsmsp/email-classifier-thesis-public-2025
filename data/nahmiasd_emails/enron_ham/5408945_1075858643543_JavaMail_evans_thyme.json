{"email_subject": "FW: El Paso Capacity", "email_body": "John, The spreadsheet below (\"Valuation Summary..\") calculates the value Enron would realize if we turned back the capacity or released it at full tolls. As of 9/17 mids, the 200,000/d leg would generate $16,918,907 if turned back. There is still a substantial amount of value above variable costs on the books. For 03-06, variable costs are around $0.15 but the mid-market spread is $0.45. The PV volume for that term is 22,000 contracts.
