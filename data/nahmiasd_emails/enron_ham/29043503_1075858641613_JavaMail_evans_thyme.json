{"email_subject": "RE:", "email_body": "I am glad we finally heard from Kevin Kolb. I would like to close the book on the stagecoach. I will be out of the office next Wednesday through Friday. I would like to execute the partnership documents on Monday or Tuesday, if possible. Sorry to hear about your wife's condition. She will be in our prayers.

Subject: Re: Phillip, I received an email from Kevin Kolb with comments on the settlement agreement that i had prepared and sent out quite a while ago. I will contact him and try to reach agreement on all points. I will be at MD Anderson this afternoon with my wife - she is starting chemo today - but I will check my email tonight and tomorrow. If you have any questions or comments, just leave a note and I will respond. Thanks. Jacques", "id": "29043503_1075858641613_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
