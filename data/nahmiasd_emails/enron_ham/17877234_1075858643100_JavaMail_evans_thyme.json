We thought this would be a good starting point for our discussion of examples and scenarios at next Tuesday's meeting. Any stories you have related to these mistakes will be extremely helpful. During the meeting, we can also get from you the names of anyone else who might be able to provide us with good examples of these mistakes. Please let me know if you have any questions.
