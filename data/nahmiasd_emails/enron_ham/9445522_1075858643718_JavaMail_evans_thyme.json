{"email_subject": "RE: Log Home Site", "email_body": "I like these homes much better than the one from earlier this week. I like the steeper pitched roof and the high glass windows in the top of the gables. Plus these seem a little bigger. I like the floor plan of the hoover plan better than the van gendersen. The kitchen should be bigger. You could take some space from the sewing room and add an island to the kitchen. -----Original Message----- From: Richter, Jeff Sent: Friday, October 05, 2001 9:42 AM To: Allen, Phillip K.
