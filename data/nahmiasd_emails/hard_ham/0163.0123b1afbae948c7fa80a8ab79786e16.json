It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day\nof the deadline for companies to certify their financial\nstatements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited\nfor the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words\ntomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave \nthe commission its latest layoff numbers.\n\nIBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings\nreport, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope.\n(\"Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way...\") Only after\n\"months of surreptitious layoff notices\" did the company admit\nthat it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's\nabout 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. \nAn IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher\nnumber was due to \"rebalancing\" and more employees than expected \ntaking voluntary layoffs. \n\nSorry, we're still back on \"rebalancing.\" Did IBM \"rightsize\"\nlast quarter, too?\n\nIBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some\ndetails were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's\nmicroelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT\nservices and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees \nfrom PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.)\nLook for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such\nas Austin and Raleigh. \n\nOK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're\nstill tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so\nbad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting\nregulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for \"stealth\nlayoffs,\" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced\nit to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the\nlatest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give\nspecifics.

Now Vivendi Universal's top\nman has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced\ntoday that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle \nup some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book\npublisher Houghton Mifflin. \n\nIt's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine\nturnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply\nfollowing the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe\n$18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian\nreported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when\ninvestors got the willies about the company's impending\nannouncement on its financial health. But the company had\npositive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first \nhalf was up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7%\nboost. \n\nDetails are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring\nefforts, with more information expected at the next board\nmeeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton\nMifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague\nexplanation that included the \"Curious George\" character, were\nthe only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian\nspeculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games\nbusiness and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone\ncompany SFR, a debatable sale because of the cash it generates,\naccording to the newspaper. \n\nMeanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues\nto advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources\nsay Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough\nto let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan\nabode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an\nunrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the\nMediterranean.
