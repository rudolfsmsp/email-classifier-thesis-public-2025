BellSouth stock tumbled 18.07 percent after it missed Wall Street's earnings target and offered a worse-than-expected outlook. With shares of SBC Communications, Qwest Communications International, Sprint and AT&T also dropping, CNET's Tech index shed 48.86 points, or 5.3 percent, to 897.37. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 36.5 points, or 2.77 percent, to 1,282.55. With a report raising questions about Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s role in the Enron fiasco, broader markets lost ground as well. After a see-saw session, the Dow Jones industrials ended down 234.7 points, or 2.93 percent, to 7,784.5. The S&P 500 slid 27.90 points, or 3.29 percent, to 819.85."}
