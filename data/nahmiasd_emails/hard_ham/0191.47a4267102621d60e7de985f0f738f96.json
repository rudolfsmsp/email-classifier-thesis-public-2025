From 29th July to\n2nd August Microsoft MVP, ASPToday author and www.xmlforasp.net/ founder\nDan Wahlin presents a series of specially commissioned articles, telling\nyou all you need to know about XML support in ASP.NET. Drawing on his\nexperience of consulting and XML training, Dan's articles will allow\nanyone interested in XML to quickly get up to speed in this important\nsubject.\n\nRead more about ASPToday's Guru Weeks:\nhttp://www.wrox.com/ACON7.asp?art_type=1&id=809&tid026\n\n\n***Updating Data Safely with A DataSet, by Alex Homer\n\nOK, so we can\u0092t store all three values for a row (the current, original\nand the underlying values) in the tables of our DataSet. Is this actually\nimportant? What do we actually need to perform the process, and what do\nusers actually expect to see? Can we make do with just two values instead\nof three, (and don\u0092t you hate books that keep asking questions)?\n\nRead the rest of Alex Homer's article here:\nhttp://www.wrox.com/ACON7.asp?art_type=1&id=810&tid026\n\n==========\nWROX ANNOUNCEMENTS\n==========\n\nAuthor Interviews\n\n***With Fran\u00e7ois Liger, Craig McQueen and Paul Wilton, authors of Visual\nBasic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook.\n\n[AP] What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET\ndeveloper, and so who do you think needs this book?\n\n[CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming\ntasks. String manipulation is a large part of programming and it is\ndifficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in\nfinding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that\nis already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers.\n\n[PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and\nregular expressions are not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are\nthe stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a\ngreat insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the\nregular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight\nin gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work\nwith when writing the book.\n\n[AP] In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET. \n\nRead the interview in full:\nhttp://www.wrox.com/ACON7.asp?art_type=2&id=808&tid026\n\nOr read about Visual Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook:\nhttp://www.wrox.com/ACON11.asp?ISBN=1861007302&tid026\n\n\n***With Tobin Titus, author of Visual Basic .NET Threading Handbook\n\nIn June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET.\nThere has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out\non what seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin\nTitus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on\nthe book, as well getting his opinions on various programming-related\ntopics.\n\nWhat is free threading? \n\nFree threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an\napplication. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of\nthreading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those\nthreads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the\ndeveloper to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should\nend, and what it should do while executing.\n\nRead the interview in full here:\nhttp://www.wrox.com/ACON7.asp?art_type=2&id=805&tid026\n\nOr read about Visual Basic .NET Threading Handbook:\nhttp://www.wrox.com/ACON11.asp?ISBN=1861007132&tid026\n\n\n***C#Today Free Code Download\n\nDue to customer feedback, C#Today have decided to try out something new\nthis week - we are making this week's code  download \\ support material\navailable to all non-subscribers (providing they are a member of the Wrox\nDeveloper Community, which is free to join).\n\nThis week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM \nhttp://www.csharptoday.com/content/articles/20020722.asp?&tid026\n\nThe Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate\nsource code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET\nfacility and has attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a\ncomplementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel\nobject, which allows programmatic access to hand-written code. Together\nthese two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to\ndevelop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs in\ncode. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which\nattempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an\nexisting C# or VB.NET project.\n\n\n***Get on the Fast Track to Success\n\nIf you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core\n.NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for\nyou.\n\nThe Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by\nproviding concise guides to core topics. They deliver the essential facts\nand understanding that are required to start taking advantage of .NET. By\ntargeting specific groups of experienced developers, the books are able to\nconcentrate on providing valuable information rather than covering basics.\n\nRead the full article here:\nhttp://www.wrox.com/ACON7.asp?art_type=2&id=804&tid026\n\n==========\nINFORMATION FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n==========\n\nYou can unsubscribe from this list by visiting\nhttp://www.wrox.com/ACON3.asp?tid026\n\nEnter your e-mail address into the field at the bottom of the page and\npress the \u0091unsubscribe\u0092 button.
