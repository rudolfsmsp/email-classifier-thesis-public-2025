{"email_subject": "Are bigger notebooks better?", "email_body": "One of the hot trends in notebooks is squeezing desktop processors,\nnot mobile CPUs, into laptops. Actually, the trend has been around\nfor a while, but the bigger vendors used to pooh-pooh these\nefforts. (Intel was never too crazy about the idea, either.) Now,\nit's a bona fide movement, and the latest 9.6-pound desktop-\nreplacement system from Toshiba takes this trend to new heights.\nBut questions abound: Are the extra pounds worth it? Do these \nthings really get so hot that you can press pants with them? \nExecutive Editor John Morris sorts it out for you."}
