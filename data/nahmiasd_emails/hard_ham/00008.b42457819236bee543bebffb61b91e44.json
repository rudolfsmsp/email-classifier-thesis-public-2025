I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..\n\nTo view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click here . \n\nOperating System:  \n\nAs of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways.\nOne way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com, for as little as $299. This is a significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks. \n\nFor those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we offer the Insider program. This gives people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about 80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow, consequently, this product is not yet for everyone. \n\nSome may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart when the program available directly from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is the Walmart computers are certified, ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much different than offering a software program that will work on any computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job.\n\nWhile the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B\n  _____  \n\nSoftware: \n\nOur goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school, home or business.\n\nClick-N-Run is the easiest way to load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse, users can find quality software titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point. Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future. Grade: A-\n  _____  \n\nMicrosoft Windows Compatibility:\n\nWe live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our Warehouse such as OpenOffice. \n\nMany of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since they're included in the Warehouse. Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get better in the above areas.  Grade: B \n  _____  \n\nCommunication:\n\nWe've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute. While our overall goal has not deviated - Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs, forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid. \n\nConsequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library of 1,000+ software titles all for a flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable.\n\nThere are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade: B+\n  _____  \n\nOverall: B+\n\nMichael Robertson\n\nPlease visit support.lindows.com to answer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com.\n\nBringing Choice to Your Computer! \n \nLindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a \"Friendly-Install\" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of \"bridge\" Windows-compatible programs.
