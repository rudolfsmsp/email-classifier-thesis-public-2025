{"email_subject": "SEC Exposes Big Blue's Pink Slips", "email_body": "Does the Securities and Exchange Commission have a press pass yet? It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave the commission its latest layoff numbers.\n\nIBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. (\"Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way...\") Only after \"months of surreptitious layoff notices\" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to \"rebalancing\" and more employees than expected taking voluntary layoffs. \n\nSorry, we're still back on \"rebalancing.\" Did IBM \"rightsize\" last quarter, too?\n\nIBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.) Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such as Austin and Raleigh. \n\nOK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for \"stealth layoffs,\" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give specifics.
