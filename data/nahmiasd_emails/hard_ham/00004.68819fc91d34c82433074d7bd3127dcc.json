Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN\nSPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return\naddress to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would\nplace enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and\nstate Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service\nProviders (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.\nIt would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and\nreported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further\naction in the Senate.\n\nCAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to\nmore spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law\nlast year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.\n\nOur April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems\nwith S.630:\n\n http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml\n\nWe're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and\nhope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that\nthe entire Internet community can support.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* European Union bans spam\n\nGLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTE\n\nMay 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail\n(CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against\nUnsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision\nby the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the\npractice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn\nEurope into a virtual \"spam-free zone\" after the formal adoption of the\ndirective, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or\nother similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not\nhave a preexisting business relationship.\n\n\"This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,\" said EuroCAUCE\nChairman George Mills. \"We are extremely pleased that the European\nParliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added\nthe right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the\nprivacy of Europeans.\"\n\nWhile six European Union member countries had already formalized \"opt-in\"\nin their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all\nof Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,\nincluding the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection\nof Internet users,\" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. \"This is\na tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow\nEurope's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and\nnetwork owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail\nadvertising.\"\n\n\"This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the\nEuropean Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the\nEuropean Parliament listening to their constituents,\" said Mills. \"Our\nmembers and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,\ntranslating, lobbying and educating their representatives.\"\n\nMore information on the E.U. directive is available on the European\nParliament's Web site <http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/index_en.htm>,\nand a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at\n<http://www.euro.cauce.org/en/amendments1a.html>.
