{"email_subject": "CNET: Why I don't use firewalls", "email_body": "With all the corporate scandals--such as WorldCom and Enron--surrounding us, who can you trust nowadays? Well, for starters, you can trust the CNET Message Boards. The CNET Message Boards are as real as it gets. When it comes down to giving or receiving honest tech advice, there's no better place to be. In the Boards there are no reviews or tests by professionals, just real, true-life experiences and discussions from people like you and me who share one common interest: the love of today's challenging technology. There are no sneaky execs here or scandals to worry about, so if you have a specific problem or question in mind, post it! You won't be disappointed. Lee Koo CNET Community Got suggestions?
