{"email_subject": "CONFIDENTIAL PROPOSAL [CODE NO: AM-0007]", "email_body": "\n\n\nCONFIDENTIAL PROPOSAL [CODE NO: AM-0007]\n\n\nGood Day,\n\nI am Mr. Ming Yang, Director of Operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd, Sai\nWan Ho Branch, Hong Kong. My purpose of contacting you is because you dont\nleave in Hong Kong.\n\nI have an obscured business suggestion for you.I am here-by seeking your\nservice in helping me recieve a large amount of money and in giving a\nclear research and feasibility studies on areas I could invest on. Your\nservices will be paid for, and you will be a partner, if your\nrecommendation is accepted.\n\n\nAs a bank employee, I can not operate any personal investment till I am\nretired and with the Anti-corruption Bill passed in Hong Kong; it is risky\nfor a fixed income earner to own any huge amount of money in Hong Kong or\nany foreign country. It is then advisable to invest in any foreign land\nsecretly and patiently wait retirement.\n\nFor security purpose, due to telecom interception in Hong Kong, I shall\nnot accept or acknowledge any phone call. Only fax messages/emails would\nbe treated in relation to this proposal but not without this code; [CODE\nNO: AM-0007]. Should you be further interested, I would prefer you to\nreach me soon and finally after that I shall provide you with more details\nof this operation.\n\n\nKind Regards\n\nMr. Ming Yang\nHang Seng Bank Ltd\nSai Wan Ho Branch\n171 Shaukiwan Road\nHong Kong.\nPrivate email: hangsengbank200@yahoo.com.hk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "eb3749ea040ddc988c44982708a81db8"}
