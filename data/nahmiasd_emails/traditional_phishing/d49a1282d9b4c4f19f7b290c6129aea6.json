We thus\npropose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these\nfunds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have\nbeen followed. \n\nThis transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is a legitimate\nand does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other\nillegal act. On your interest, let me hear from you.\n\nRegards,\nGordon.  \n\n\nDISCLAIMER: \nThis message contains confidential information and is intended only for\nspecified addressee.
