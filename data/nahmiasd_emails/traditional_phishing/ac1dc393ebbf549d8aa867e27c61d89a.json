{"email_subject": "REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE!!!", "email_body": "Dr.Peter Akinjide\n\nIkoyi office complex,\n\nLagos, Nigeria.\n\n\n\nDear Friend,\n\nI am Dr.Peter Akinjide,on behalf of my colleagues from different Federal\nGovernment of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance\nas regards transfer of US$41,500,000.00 (Fourty one Million,five Hundred\nThousand US Dollars)into your bank account. These funds emanated from unclaimed\ncontractual proceeds of foreign contracting firms who could not meet their\nfinancial obligations to their creditors. We, as holders of sensitive positions\nin our various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government to scrutinise\nall payments made to certain foreign contractors and we discovered that\nsome of the contractors have not been paid their contractual entitlement\nwhich collectively left the sum of US$46,500,000.00 (Fourty six Million,five\nHundred Thousand US Dollars) lying in a suspended Account.\n\nHowever,from our investigations,we discovered that the foreign beneficiary\ncompanies have since been liquidated, and to all intents and purposes no\nlonger exist in Nigeria, thus providing us with this \nopportunity,provided that we have a capable partner, to execute a transaction\nof this nature.\n\nWe agreed that the said amount would be transferred into an overseas Bank\nAccount to be provided by a reliable foreign firm/associate. This is because\nas serving Government workers the Civil Service Code does not allow us to\noperate foreign Account. In our initial attempt to do \nthis,we succeeded in transferring part of this amount US$5m (Five Million\nDollars)into a United States Dollar Account in Beirut, Lebanon, but our\nforeign associate failed to honour our mutual agreement insisting instead\nthat the total amount be transferred into the Account before we can share\nthe money.\n\nAs a result, we have lost confidence in the ability of our Lebanese partner\nto see this matter to its logical conclusion,and until the initial transaction\nis satisfactorily resolved,we have cancelled further transactions with him.In\nthe light of the foregoing,it is clear \nthat we require a partner that is not only capable of rendering assistance\nand cooperation in executing this matter, but will honour the terms of agreement\nwhen we reach the concluding stages of this transaction.\n\nWe therefore offer the amount of 20% of the entire sum in return for services/assistance\nrendered in successfully carrying out this project.We trust that you appreciate\nthe sensitive nature of this matter and the need for initial caution on\nour part, but when a relationship is confidently established and operations\ncommence you will be provided with all relevant information.\n\nI remain at your disposal to entertain any questions/enquiries relating\nto this proposition and you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e-mail\nfor further information on the procedures and requirements of this transaction.In\nyour reply, remember to indicate a safe telephone number where I can always\nreach you. Hope to hear from you soon. Please treat with the strictest confidentiality\nand expediency.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDr.Peter Akinjide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________\nTiscali Adsl 640 Free: fino al 15 novembre i consumi sono GRATIS!\nSe sottoscrivi un'Adsl Free 640 entro il 14 ottobre avrai gratis tutti\ni consumi fino al 15/11/04 compreso!
