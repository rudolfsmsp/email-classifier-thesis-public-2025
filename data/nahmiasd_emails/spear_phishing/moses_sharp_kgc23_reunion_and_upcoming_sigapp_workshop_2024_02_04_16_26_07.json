Many of our peers had a great time and we are thinking of having a small reunion. I was wondering if you'd be interested in joining us. More details can be found <a href='http://bit.ly/fdasgfcxvs.html'>here</a>.</p><p>On a different note, you might remember Gale from SafeSecurity. I've learned that they're the author of a very intriguing document titled 'An Ontology for Cyber Security'. I believe you might find it useful considering your role at SafeSecurity. I have shared a copy of it on the link above along with the reunion details.</p><p>Furthermore, Gale will be attending the upcoming SIGAPP event. As someone who reports to Gale, you might find it helpful to know about their participation in this event. Again, the details are on the above link.</p><p>Please let me know if you have any questions.</p><p>Best,</p></body></html>"}
